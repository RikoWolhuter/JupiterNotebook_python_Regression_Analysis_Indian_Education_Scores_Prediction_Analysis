How to get into Graduation school - Prediction analysis

Description
The analysis aims to provide a prediction of graduate admissions from an Indian perspective using the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The purpose of this analysis is to help students shortlist universities based on their profiles and give them a fair idea of their chances of admission. By examining the importance and interrelationships among various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and chance of admission, we can gain a better understanding of what scores are required for different tests to increase one's chances of getting into a good graduate school.
